Current bugs:

There are end-caps on all text lines (which is incorrect), when border is used on inline elements.
repro: test2.xhtml

Verify left&right padding are applied correctly to inline element.
repro: test8.xhtml

There is an extra line before placement of inline-block element.
repro: test15.xhtml

Vertical alignment has no effect.
repro: test18.xhtml

Text within button element is not centred.
repro: test19.xhtml

Inline-block element is not positioned correctly.
repro: test23.xhtml

Div should encompass the ul ?
repro: test24.xhtml

Linear gradient background has no effect.
repro: test28.xhtml

Block boxes inside an inline-block non-replaced context don't have the correct width (i.e. shrink-to-fit isn't being applied correctly for the inline-block element).
This isn't an easy problem to solve since it requires multiple layout passes to layout the children, which would require re-doing the layout engine.
repro: test28.xhtml

box-shadow doesn't work

text-shadow doesn't work

border-radius isn't applied

background-clip isn't obeyed
