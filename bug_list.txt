Block boxes inside an inline-block non-replaced context don't have the correct width (i.e. shrink-to-fit isn't being applied correctly for the inline-block element).
This isn't an easy problem to solve since it requires multiple layout passes to layout the children, which would require re-doing the layout engine.

There isn't any gap between a character with a descent (i.e. lowercase p) and the border element.
